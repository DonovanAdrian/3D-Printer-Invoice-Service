## Welcome!
This website is meant to be a simple algorithm that 
calculates the approximate cost of each 3D print that 
I make. This will help streamline the process of 
creating invoices for people who order 3D prints from 
me.


## How Well Does This Work?
I'm not sure yet! This is still being created.
